Project 1/30 from WesBos JavaScript30 challenge, consisting on building 30 things in 30 days with pure JavaScript.

1.  How to take advantage of JavaScript event keycode so that when someomes hits a key in their keyboard an audio element associated with that key will be played.
2. Adding animations with transform and transition attributes.
3. Understanding how to make up attributes with the data type attribute.
4. After the tutorial, I decided to extend the JavaScript functionality with the click event so that when someones clicks on the corresponding element the program also works.
